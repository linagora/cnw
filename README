compose_newwindow is a Roundcube webmail plugin that changes the behavior
of the default compose / reply / forward buttons in the main mail list so
that they open the new message in a separate window (or tab depending on
your browser settings)

Stable releases in TAR format are available under Downloads.

To download the current source in either ZIP or TAR format
click on the 'Download Source' button near the top.

The zip or tar.gz file will have a xrxca-cnw-????? directory
that will contain the actual compose_newwindow plugin directory
move/copy the compose_newwindow directory to your plugins
directory and enable the plugin in your config/main.inc.php file.
